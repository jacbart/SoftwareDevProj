**That** **CS** **Guide** is a site created by [Cash Johnson](https://github.com/cashjohnson), [Elijah Clarke](https://github.com/ElijahClarke), [Holden Sheftel](https://github.com/holdenout), [Jack Bartlett](https://github.com/jacbart) and [Matt Sredojevic](https://github.com/Matt-Sredojevic) for the final project of CSCI 3308. The site is a collection of tutorials and other helpful materials that we thought would have been useful to have all in one place. The site is PHP and MySQL based. It is hosted by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and the MySQL database is hosted by [ClearDB](https://www.cleardb.com).
